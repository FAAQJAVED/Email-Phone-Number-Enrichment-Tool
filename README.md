# 📧 Email Enricher

> **Two-pass contact enricher** — scrapes email addresses and phone numbers from company websites using a fast HTTP pass followed by a Playwright headless-browser fallback. Built for high-volume B2B lead generation pipelines.

## What it does

- **Ingests any CSV** with a website/URL column — no renaming of files or headers required
- **Pass 1 (HTTP):** fires lightweight `requests` GET calls at the homepage and up to 4 contact sub-pages, extracting plaintext and Cloudflare-obfuscated emails + phone numbers
- **Pass 2 (Browser):** runs headless Chromium via Playwright on every site that Pass 1 missed — handles JavaScript-rendered pages, SPAs, and React/Next.js frontends
- **Outputs** a styled Excel workbook (Results sheet + Run Stats sheet) plus a CSV backup

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dual-pass architecture** | Fast `requests` first (~80% hit rate), Playwright fallback for the rest |
| **Cloudflare decoding** | Decodes `data-cfemail` and `/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#` XOR-obfuscated emails |
| **Email quality scoring** | Personal names score 1 (best), generic addresses 2–3, junk is filtered entirely |
| **Phone extraction** | `tel:` href links (highest confidence) → regex fallback for 3 international formats |
| **Cookie banner dismissal** | 10 configurable Playwright selectors, silently ignored on failure |
| **Atomic checkpoint** | Writes to `.tmp` then `os.replace()` — no data loss on crash or kill |
| **Resume anywhere** | Re-run the same command to continue; already-processed sites are never re-scraped |
| **Background auto-save** | Saves every 60 s (configurable) + every 10 sites in both passes |
| **Cross-platform controls** | P / R / Q / S keys (Windows: no Enter; Mac/Linux: type + Enter) |
| **Remote command file** | `echo pause > command.txt` controls a running process without killing it |
| **winsound beeps** | Audio feedback for start, pause, resume, done — silently skipped on non-Windows |
| **Disk space guard** | Pauses before the output volume fills up during long runs |
| **Auto-pause on outage** | Polls every 30 s and resumes automatically when internet is restored |
| **Wall-clock stop time** | `stop_at: "23:00"` halts the run and saves a resumable checkpoint |
| **User-agent rotation** | Randomised from a configurable pool on every request |
| **XLSX Run Stats sheet** | Hit rates, per-pass counts, elapsed time — all in Sheet 2 of the output |
| **tqdm progress bar** | Live count, hit%, and ETA for both passes (graceful shim if tqdm is absent) |

## Real Results

> Tested against 3,000+ UK property-sector websites (letting agents, block managers, HMO landlords).

- **~80% hit rate on Pass 1** (plain HTTP) — most sites serve contact emails in static HTML
- **Additional ~10–15%** recovered by Pass 2 (Playwright) on JS-heavy property portals
- **Cloudflare-protected sites** decoded correctly — XOR key is extracted and applied per address
- Full run of 1,200 sites completes in **~35–45 minutes** on a standard broadband connection

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAAQJAVED/Email-Phone-Number-Enrichment-Tool.git
cd Email-Phone-Number-Enrichment-Tool
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Playwright Chromium

```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Run

```bash
# Auto-detects your CSV and column names
python enricher.py

# Or specify explicitly
python enricher.py --input leads.csv --output results.xlsx
```

---

## Input Format

Drop **any CSV** with a website/URL column into the project folder. The tool auto-detects headers — no renaming needed.

```csv
Company Name,Website,Category
Acme Lettings,https://acmelettings.co.uk,Letting Agent
City Block Mgmt,https://cityblock.co.uk,Block Manager
Prime HMO Ltd,https://primehmo.com,HMO Landlord
```

**Detected automatically by keyword matching:**

| Field | Detected by keywords | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| Website / URL | `website` `url` `domain` `site` `web` `link` `homepage` | ✅ Yes |
| Company Name | `company` `name` `organisation` `organization` `business` `firm` `client` `brand` `title` | No — falls back to first column |
| Category | `category` `type` `sector` `industry` `segment` `group` `vertical` | No — omitted silently |
| Pre-existing Phone | `phone` `tel` `mobile` `cell` `number` `contact number` | No — carried through to output |

Override auto-detection in `config.yaml` under `columns:` if needed.

## Output Format

### Excel workbook — `found_contacts_YYYYMMDD.xlsx`

**Sheet 1 — Results**

| Company Name | Website | Email | Phone | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acme Lettings | https://acmelettings.co.uk | james@acmelettings.co.uk | +44 20 7946 0123 | Letting Agent |
| City Block Mgmt | https://cityblock.co.uk | info@cityblock.co.uk | (020) 3456 7890 | Block Manager |

**Sheet 2 — Run Stats**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Run Timestamp | 2024-12-01 22:14:03 |
| Input File | leads.csv |
| Companies Input | 1,200 |
| Contacts Found | 960 |
| — Emails Found | 912 |
| — Phones Found | 690 |
| Email Success Rate | 76% |
| Phone Success Rate | 57% |
| Any Contact Rate | 80% |
| Still Missing | 240 |
| Pass 1 Found | 720 |
| Pass 2 Found | 240 |
| Time Elapsed | [42m18s] |

A **CSV backup** is always written alongside the Excel file (used for resume on next run).

---

## Runtime Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `P` | Pause / Resume |
| `R` | Resume (if paused) |
| `Q` | Quit and save progress |
| `S` | Print current status |

> **Windows:** single keypress — no Enter required (uses `msvcrt`).
> **Mac / Linux:** type the letter then press **Enter** (uses `select` + stdin).

**Remote control via file** (works while the script is running in a terminal or scheduled task):

```bash
echo pause   > command.txt   # pause after current site
echo resume  > command.txt   # resume
echo stop    > command.txt   # save and exit
echo fresh   > command.txt   # delete checkpoint (restart on next run)
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` — every option is documented inline. Key settings:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input_file` | `""` | Blank = auto-detect CSV in current directory |
| `output_file` | `""` | Blank = auto-generate `found_contacts_YYYYMMDD.xlsx` |
| `output_format` | `"xlsx"` | `"xlsx"` or `"csv"` |
| `http_timeout` | `[4, 6]` | `[connect_timeout, read_timeout]` in seconds |
| `playwright_timeout` | `8000` | Page load timeout in ms (Pass 2) |
| `browser_restart_every` | `150` | Restart Chromium every N sites (prevents memory leak) |
| `stop_at` | `"23:00"` | Wall-clock auto-stop time (blank to disable) |
| `autosave_interval` | `60` | Background save every N seconds |
| `rate_limit.min_seconds` | `0.1` | Minimum delay between requests |
| `rate_limit.max_seconds` | `0.5` | Maximum delay between requests |
| `contact_paths` | `["/contact", ...]` | Sub-pages visited per site |
| `skip_email_keywords` | `[noreply, gdpr, ...]` | Emails matching these are discarded |
| `generic_email_keywords` | `[info, hello, ...]` | Emails matching these are scored lower |
| `junk_email_domains` | `[sentry.io, ...]` | Emails from these domains are discarded |
| `cookie_selectors` | `[button:has-text(...)]` | Playwright cookie-dismiss selectors |

Copy `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml` to get started.

| Library | Role |
|---|---|
| `requests` | Pass 1 — fast, lightweight HTTP GET with threading-based hard timeout |
| `playwright` | Pass 2 — headless Chromium for JavaScript-rendered pages |
| `openpyxl` | Excel output with styled headers and Run Stats sheet |
| `pyyaml` | YAML config loading with default fallback |
| `tqdm` | Live terminal progress bar with ETA for both passes |
| `urllib3` | SSL warning suppression for sites with invalid certificates |

---

## Notes

- `robots.txt` is **not** enforced automatically — ensure your use case complies with each site's terms of service and applicable law.
- SSL certificate errors are suppressed to handle sites with expired or self-signed certificates.
- No data is stored or transmitted externally — all output is written locally.
- The `sync_playwright().__enter__()` pattern is used instead of `with sync_playwright() as p:` to avoid a Windows + Python 3.12 ContextVar incompatibility.
